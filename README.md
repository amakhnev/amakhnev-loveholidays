# Assignment: Flights finder.

## Challenge

The following matrix represents the cost of flying between Castle Black, Winterfell, Riverrun and King's Landing.
```
costs =
[[0, 15, 80, 90],
[0, 0, 40, 50],
[0, 0, 0, 70],
[0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

For example:
* Flying from Castle Black to Winterfell costs 15 Silver Stags ( costs[0][1] )
* Flying from Castle Black to King's Landing costs 90 Silver Stags ( costs[0][3] )
* Flying from Riverrun to King's Landing costs 70 Silver Stags ( costs[2][3] )

You can only fly from north to south, e.g you can fly from Winterfell to King's Landing, but not from King's Landing to Riverrun.

Write an algorithm to find the cost for each possible flight path from one location to another, where the two locations are given
as inputs, and write them to standard output.
The expected end solution should work like this:
```
./bin/list-flight-paths "Castle Black" "Winterfell"
Castle Black -> Winterfell: 15

./bin/list-flight-paths "Castle Black" "Riverrun"
Castle Black -> Winterfell -> Riverrun: 55
Castle Black -> Riverrun: 80
```
Where the command should be:
```
./bin/list-flight-paths "[location1]" "[location2]"
```

We expect that the command outlined in this document is adhered to when writing the submission, as it's how we test the code.

There are a few things we'd expect from a submission:
* A README to understand how to run it - if there are packages to install, etc
* The solution should work with any square, up to 8x8 flight costs matrix
* The solution should be properly tested
* The program should use standard streams and exit codes

A few notes on the test:
* We donâ€™t mind what programming language you use
* We value simple systems that are easy to communicate and understand

## Additional assumptions
- input data needs to be validated, i.e. city name should present in corresponding DAO
- in case of any error only code and meaningful message should be shown to user
- no path found is an error and should be indicated by giving message to user
- price is integer
- routes output is sorted by price


## Solution description

### Architecture and decisions explained
Application consists of follow layers:
- FlightsFinderApp - command line application which receives input data as parameters / writes output to system console and handles received checked exceptions.
- Repository layer is responsible for getting cities and prices data. Price matrix is stored in csv file with header being names of cities, alternative implementation of repository are possible.
- Service layer contains business logic of searching all available routes via recursion with intermediate storage. Assumption of limiting number of cities to 8 makes it possible, it will not work with scaling number of cities post 30-40 with each-to-each-next flights possible
- Original problem does not sound complex, hence decision was made to complete without using of dependency injection frameworks, i.e. Spring. However even on this small project it's evident DI framework would benefit in better wiring so if I would do it again I prefer to use Spring.
- Unit test coverage is 100% classes, 93% lines.  

### How to build
Open project in IDE of choice as Java Maven project, execute maven `package` goal. It will run unit tests and export jar file.

Alternatively with maven installed,go to project folder and execute `mvn package` command

This would trigger tests and creation of flightsfinder-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar file in {project home}/target directory

### How to run
#### prerequisites:
* JRE installed, version 11+. Can check with running `java --version`
* flightsfinder-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar has been created (see previous section) 

#### execution:
App can be triggered by executing follow command in Windows ... 
```
./list-flight-paths.cmd "[location1]" "[location2]"
```
... or in Linux
```
 ./list-flight-paths.sh "[location1]" "[location2]"
```

Alternatively, follow command can be triggered to call app explicitly
```
java -cp .\target\flightsfinder-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.amakhnev.loveholidays.flightsfinder.FlightsFinderApp "[location1]" "[location2]"
```
#### running from IDE
Execute method main in `com.amakhnev.loveholidays.flightsfinder.FlightsFinderApp` class, adding list of cities as input parameters in the running configuration
